# Unscented Kalman Filter Project Starter Code
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project an Unscented Kalman Filter is used to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. 

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

And intall [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./UnscentedKF

## Install dependencies

The **install-ubuntu.sh** script installs all the required dependencies.

```
git clone <CarND-Unscented-Kalman-Filter-Project>
cd CarND-Unscented-Kalman-Filter-Project
chmod +x install-ubuntu.sh 
./install-ubuntu.sh 
```
## Other Important Dependencies
* cmake >= 3.5
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./UnscentedKF` Previous versions use i/o from text files.  The current state uses i/o
from the simulator.
